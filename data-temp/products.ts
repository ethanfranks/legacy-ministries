      "We’re so excited to present our newly dubbed Legacy House Coffee! If you don’t know where to start with our coffees, this one is what we’d recommend. It’s a perfect middle ground with some darker flavor notes and yet still lots of fruity brightness, perfect for drip coffee or espresso!\nNow, getting a bit nerdy, this is the sibling coffee of the Finca La Hermosa Natural Process…the Finca La Hermosa Washed Process! Arriving once again from our friends whom we direct trade with at Collaborative Origins Imports (previously Yepocapa Coffee), this certified organic Guatemalan coffee is the washed version of the Natural Process coffee we have in stock. The varying production methods, namely drying the beans within their coffee cherries (the Natural Process) or not (the Washed Process), produce two very different yet delicious coffees. Whereas the Natural Process goes more berry, the Washed Process presents more tropical fruit and baking spice flavors.",
